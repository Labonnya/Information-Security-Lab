Folder Description: AES Algorithm and SHA-512 Algorithm Code

This folder contains the implementation of two cryptographic algorithms: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and SHA-512 (Secure Hash Algorithm 512). These algorithms are widely used in the field of information security for encryption and hash function purposes respectively.

1. AES Algorithm:
The AES algorithm is a symmetric encryption algorithm that operates on fixed-length blocks of data. The code in this folder provides the functionality to encrypt and decrypt data using AES with different key sizes (128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit). It includes the necessary functions for key expansion, substitution, permutation, and transformation of data blocks to ensure secure encryption and decryption.

2. SHA-512 Algorithm:
The SHA-512 algorithm is a cryptographic hash function that generates a fixed-size hash value (512 bits) for a given input data. The code in this folder implements the SHA-512 algorithm, which involves a series of logical operations such as message padding, message expansion, compression, and final hash generation. It allows the computation of the SHA-512 hash value for input data, providing data integrity and authenticity.

These algorithms are fundamental components of modern cryptography and are widely used in various applications, including secure communication, data protection, and authentication. The code in this folder offers a practical implementation of AES and SHA-512 algorithms, enabling developers to incorporate strong encryption and hash functions into their projects, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.
